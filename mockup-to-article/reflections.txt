Your response goes here!
I have learned basics of web development so far and I am loving it.
Since I was familiar with the basics beforehand, everything has been easy as of yet.
Nothing has been difficult yet.
When I felt stuck at one problem, I first tried my ways to get around it, and if I was still in the same place, I googled my problem.
